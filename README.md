# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Visualizer** built using React that allows users to visualize popular sorting algorithms. Users can choose between **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Bubble Sort** to observe how these algorithms sort an array of numbers step by step. The sorting process is visually represented by bars of different heights, which change color and adjust dynamically as the algorithms compare, swap, and arrange the numbers.

This tool helps users understand the inner workings of each sorting algorithm through animated visual feedback. While sorting is in progress, the user interface disables all buttons to prevent interference with the sorting process, ensuring a smooth and clear visualization experience.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Visual Representation of Sorting Algorithms**: The height of each bar corresponds to the value of an element in the array. As sorting occurs, the bars change color and height to reflect comparisons and swaps.
  
- **Interactive UI**: Users can generate a new array, control the speed of the animations, and choose different sorting algorithms from the interface.

- **Algorithms Supported**:
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
  - **Bubble Sort**

- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Disable Buttons During Sorting**: Buttons like "Generate New Array" and algorithm selection buttons are disabled during sorting to avoid disruption.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the array bars and handling transitions and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implementations of sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort).
