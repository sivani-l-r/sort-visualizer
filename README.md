# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Visualizer** built using React that allows users to visualize popular sorting algorithms. Users can choose between **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Bubble Sort** to observe how these algorithms sort an array of numbers step by step. The sorting process is visually represented by bars of different heights, which change color and adjust dynamically as the algorithms compare, swap, and arrange the numbers.

This tool helps users understand the inner workings of each sorting algorithm through animated visual feedback. While sorting is in progress, the user interface disables all buttons to prevent interference with the sorting process, ensuring a smooth and clear visualization experience.

## Algorithms Supported
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the array bars and handling transitions and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implementations of sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort).
